# HR Analytics Dashboard

## Problem Statement

The primary goal of this project is to analyze employee attrition in a company using HR data. High employee turnover can negatively impact productivity and increase operational costs, so understanding the key factors behind attrition is crucial. The following questions are addressed:

- What is the overall employee attrition rate?
- How do age, job role, salary, and tenure affect attrition?
- Which departments or roles experience the highest turnover?
- What patterns can be observed to help reduce future attrition?


## Steps followed 

1. Data Collection:
- HR data including employee details such as age, salary, job role, years at the company, education field, and gender were used for analysis.

2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:
- Cleaned the data to ensure consistency and remove any missing or duplicate values.
- Segmented data into key categories (age groups, job roles, salary slabs, and years at the company) to facilitate better analysis.

3. Data Analysis:
- Attrition Analysis: Calculated the overall attrition rate (16.1%) by analyzing employee exit data.
- Age Group Analysis: Segmented employees by age groups to identify which group faces the highest attrition. For instance, the age group 26-35 had the most attrition cases.
- Job Role Analysis: Analyzed attrition by job roles, revealing that roles like Laboratory Technician and Sales Executive had higher turnover.
- Salary Slabs: Divided employees by salary categories to see if compensation levels affected attrition. Employees earning up to 5K experienced the highest attrition.
- Years at Company: Examined how long employees stayed before leaving, revealing that those with 0-5 years of experience had the highest turnover.

4. Visualization with Power BI:
- Created interactive visualizations (bar charts, pie charts, etc.) to showcase data patterns, including attrition by gender, age, and salary. Power BI provided a clear view of how different variables impact attrition.
5. Insights Generation:
- Generated actionable insights based on the patterns identified through analysis.

# Insights

A single page report was created on Power BI Desktop. Following inferences can be drawn from the dashboard;

### [1] Attrition Rate: 

- The company has an overall attrition rate of 16.1%, which can have a significant impact on workforce stability.

           
### [2] Key Age Group:

- Employees in the 26-35 age group exhibited the highest attrition, with 116 cases. This suggests potential dissatisfaction or opportunities for career progression among mid-career employees.
  
### [3] Job Role Trends:

- Laboratory Technicians and Sales Executives had the highest attrition counts (62 and 57, respectively), indicating that these roles may need attention in terms of job satisfaction, workload, or compensation.

### [4] Salary Impact:

- The majority of employees leaving earned up to 5K, suggesting a link between lower compensation and higher attrition.

### [5] Tenure Insights:

- Employees with less than 5 years at the company showed higher turnover, indicating that onboarding, career growth opportunities, or early retention efforts may need improvement.

# Conclusion
This HR Analytics Dashboard provides valuable insights into employee attrition, highlighting the need to focus on specific job roles, salary bands, and early career employees to reduce turnover. By leveraging these findings, HR teams can implement targeted strategies to improve employee retention and satisfaction.
